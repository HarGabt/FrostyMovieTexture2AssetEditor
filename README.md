# MovieTexture2Asset Plugin for Frosty Tool Suite 1.0.7

This plugin adds import and export buttons to the toolbar when a **MovieTexture2Asset** is open. 
When importing, ChunkSize is automatically updated, although that change is not displayed in the UI unless you close and reopen the asset.

Basically, it lets you replace in-game videos. Supports both **MovieTexture2Asset** and **MovieTextureAsset** type assets.
